//We are going to make a program that adds two number together. It needs to be printed out in the terminal. Add data validation and a play again feature.
//Peer Reivew: Pedro Castaneda - Your validation for the numbers works great, but validation for the playAgain feature has a bug. It exits the program with no issues when you input 'end' but if you leave a blank entry or enter anything else it reruns the program but it does not reset the game. Check to see where you initialize your variables and see if you need to move them somewhere else. Other than that great work.
